[18:00] ZeroCool: Alright, everyone here? We need to finalize the plan for tonight.

[18:01] AcidBurn: Here. I've got the station's security schedule and access codes.

[18:02] PhantomPhreak: Present. Network map is ready. I can disable their firewall for a 3-minute window.

[18:03] LordNikon: Ready. I've memorized the building layout. I can guide you through once you're inside.

[18:04] CerealKiller: I'm here! I've got the snacks for our victory party!

[18:05] ZeroCool: Focus, Cereal. Okay, let's go over the plan one last time.

[18:06] AcidBurn: I'll enter through the back door at 22:30. Zero, you're with me. Phreak, you'll be in the van, handling remote access.

[18:07] ZeroCool: Right. Nikon, you'll be our eyes outside. Cereal, you're on distraction duty if needed.

[18:08] CerealKiller: Can my distraction involve a pizza delivery?

[18:09] AcidBurn: No, Cereal. Just stick to the plan.

[18:10] ZeroCool: Once inside, we'll have 15 minutes to reach the broadcast room, insert our video, and get out. Questions?

[18:11] PhantomPhreak: What if something goes wrong? We need a way to communicate quickly.

[18:12] AcidBurn: Got that covered. I snagged us some pagers. Untraceable, on a secure network.

[18:13] ZeroCool: Nice work, Acid. Those are for emergencies only, got it? We can't risk unnecessary communication.

[18:14] CerealKiller: Pagers? Sweet! Can I use mine to order pizza?

[18:15] AcidBurn: No, Cereal! Emergency use only.

[18:16] ZeroCool: I mean it, guys. These are a last resort. Don't use them unless absolutely necessary.

[18:17] LordNikon: What are the emergency codes?

[18:18] AcidBurn: "Gibson" means abort mission. "Plague" means we've been spotted. "Jolt" means success.

[18:19] CerealKiller: Can I add "Pepperoni" as a code for...

[18:20] ZeroCool: No, Cereal! Focus!

[18:21] PhantomPhreak: What's our exit strategy?

[18:22] ZeroCool: Once the video is playing, we have 3 minutes to get out. Meet at the rendezvous point - the arcade.

[18:23] AcidBurn: Remember, if we pull this off, we expose The Plague and clear our names.

[18:24] LordNikon: And if we don't?

[18:25] ZeroCool: Let's not think about that. We can do this.

[18:26] CerealKiller: Hack the planet?

[18:27] ZeroCool: Hack the planet. Everyone get ready. We move in 4 hours.

[18:28] AcidBurn: Good luck, everyone. See you on the other side.

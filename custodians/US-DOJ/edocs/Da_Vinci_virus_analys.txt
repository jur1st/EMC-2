DA VINCI VIRUS ANALYSIS
CONFIDENTIAL - FOR EXECUTIVE EYES ONLY

1. Overview:
The Da Vinci virus is the most sophisticated piece of malware I've ever encountered. It exhibits advanced polymorphic behavior, self-preservation mechanisms, and a multi-stage payload that can adapt to different system environments.

2. Key Features:
  - Advanced encryption (possibly military-grade)
  - Self-modifying code that changes every 3.5 minutes
  - Ability to infect and control IOT devices
  - Sophisticated anti-debugging mechanisms
  - Capability to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities

3. Implications:
  - The virus could potentially compromise our entire global infrastructure
  - Our oil tanker routing systems are particularly vulnerable
  - The Gibson supercomputer may be permanently compromised

4. Suspected Origin:
Based on the coding style and sophistication, I believe this virus was created by Eugene Belford (aka "The Plague"). However, the level of sophistication suggests he may have had help, possibly from state-level actors.

5. Recommendations:
  - Immediately isolate the Gibson and all critical systems
  - Initiate a full system wide rebuild from known clean backups
  - Contact federal authorities for assistance in tracking down Belford
  - Consider hiring the young hackers who initially discovered the virus to assist in our cybersecurity efforts

Please let me know if you need any clarification on these points. The situation is critical, and we need to act fast.

BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

SUBJECT B: Gecko secure. Line encrypted. You're clear, Plague.

SUBJECT A: About time. Do you have any idea how hot things are getting here?

SUBJECT B: Relax. You're off the grid. Even I don't know exactly where you are.

SUBJECT A: Let's keep it that way. What's the situation back in the world?

SUBJECT B: It's a circus. FBI's turning over every rock. Ellingson's stock is in the toilet. And those kids? They're all over the news. Regular cyber-folk heroes.

SUBJECT A: [Expletive deleted] Those little punks. I should've fried them when I had the chance.

SUBJECT B: Speaking of which, word is they're feeding info to the feds. Anonymous tips, real cloak and dagger stuff.

SUBJECT A: Impossible. They couldn't have traced the Da Vinci code back to me. It's too well hidden.

SUBJECT B: Don't be so sure. That Zero Cool kid, he's good. Real good.

SUBJECT A: [Sound of glass shattering] Damn it! I underestimated them once. Never again.

SUBJECT B: So what's the play? You can't hide on that island forever.

SUBJECT A: I'm working on something big. Real big. Makes the Ellingson job look like a warm-up.

SUBJECT B: Jesus, Plague. You're in enough hot water as it is.

SUBJECT A: That's why this has to work. I'm talking about erasing everything. All records, all traces, like I never existed.

SUBJECT B: You're talking about hitting the NSA? That's suicide.

SUBJECT A: No, it's survival. And I'll need your help.

SUBJECT B: I don't know, Plague. This is—

SUBJECT A: [Interrupting] You're either with me or against me. And trust me, you don't want to be against me.

SUBJECT B: [Long pause] What do you need?

SUBJECT A: That's more like it. I'm sending you a shopping list. Hardware, mostly. And I need a line on any Zero Day exploits you can find.

SUBJECT B: This is going to cost you.

SUBJECT A: Money's not a problem. You know that.

SUBJECT B: It's not just about money. If this goes south—

SUBJECT A: It won't. [Pause] Oh, and one more thing. Find out where Margo Wallace is being held. She's a loose end I need to tie up.

SUBJECT B: Plague, that's—

SUBJECT A: [Interrupting] Just do it. I'll be in touch.

[Sound of connection terminating]

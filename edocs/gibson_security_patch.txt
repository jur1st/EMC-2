Title: Gibson Supercomputer Security Enhancement Patch

1. OVERVIEW
This document outlines the technical specifications for a comprehensive security patch designed to address vulnerabilities exploited in the recent cyber attack on the Gibson supercomputer.

2. OBJECTIVES
2.1 Eliminate known vulnerabilities in the Gibson's operating system
2.2 Implement advanced intrusion detection and prevention systems
2.3 Enhance access control and authentication mechanisms
2.4 Improve logging and auditing capabilities

3. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Operating System Hardening
	- Upgrade core OS to version 7.2.1
	- Implement kernel-level security enhancements (see Appendix A)
	- Close ports 1337, 8080, and 31337

3.2 Access Control
	- Implement multi-factor authentication for all user accounts
	- Enforce complex password policy (min 12 characters, alphanumeric with special chars)
	- Implement IP whitelisting for remote access

3.3 Encryption
	- Upgrade to 2048-bit RSA for key exchange
	- Implement AES-256 for data-at-rest encryption
	- Enable perfect forward secrecy for all network communications

3.4 Intrusion Detection/Prevention
	- Deploy next-gen firewall with deep packet inspection
	- Implement behavior-based anomaly detection
	- Set up honeypot systems to detect and trap potential intruders

3.5 Logging and Auditing
	- Enhance syslog to capture detailed event information
	- Implement centralized log management with real-time analysis
	- Set up automated alerts for suspicious activities

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

4.1 Patch Components
	- OS_update_7.2.1.bin (1.2 GB)
	- Gibson_IDS_v3.5.pkg (500 MB)
	- AccessControl_MFA_2.0.sh (50 MB)
	- EncryptionUpgrade_AES256.bin (300 MB)
	- LogEnhancement_v2.1.tar.gz (100 MB)

4.2 Deployment Process
	1. Back up all critical data
	2. Take Gibson offline during a planned maintenance window
	3. Apply OS update and restart system
	4. Deploy remaining patch components
	5. Run comprehensive system diagnostics
	6. Perform penetration testing to verify patch effectiveness

4.3 Rollback Plan
	In case of critical failure, revert to backup image GIB_BACKUP_19950824.img

5. TESTING PROCEDURES
5.1 Unit testing of individual patch components
5.2 Integration testing in isolated environment
5.3 Full system test on Gibson backup hardware
5.4 Penetration testing by external security firm (pending approval)

6. POTENTIAL RISKS
6.1 Temporary system downtime during patch deployment (est. 4-6 hours)
6.2 Potential compatibility issues with legacy Ellingson software
6.3 Learning curve for users adapting to new security measures

7. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
7.1 Regular security audits (recommend quarterly)
7.2 Continuous monitoring and updating of security protocols
7.3 Staff training on new security measures and best practices

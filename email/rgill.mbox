Team,

We've received intelligence about a potential cyber attack on Ellingson Mineral Company. I want all hands on deck for this one.

Jenkins, I need you to liaise with Ellingson's IT department. Moore, start background checks on all Ellingson employees with high-level system access.

This could be big, people. Let's not drop the ball.

Sir,

The situation at Ellingson is escalating. We've confirmed a breach of their systems, including their Gibson supercomputer.

Initial evidence points to a group of young hackers, but something doesn't add up. I suspect there might be an inside man.

I'm heading to Ellingson HQ now to coordinate our response on-site.

Will update as the situation develops.

Team,

We have a new person of interest: Eugene Belford, former head of IT security at Ellingson. He resigned abruptly last week and has since disappeared.

I want everything we can find on Belford. Employment history, financial records, known associates. Leave no stone unturned.

This could be the break we've been looking for.

Sir,

A group of hackers just hijacked a major TV station's broadcast. They're claiming that Eugene Belford is behind the Ellingson attack.

This is no longer just a corporate hack. We're dealing with a potential national security threat.

I'm coordinating with local law enforcement to track down these hackers. We need to bring them in for questioning ASAP.

HR Department,

It has come to my attention that I was erroneously declared deceased in the FBI's personnel system yesterday. I can assure you that I am very much alive.

Please correct this immediately. It's causing issues with my security clearances and system access.

Team,

Contrary to what our HR system might say, I am not dead. Someone (likely our hacker friends) has played a practical joke on us.

Keep focusing on the Ellingson case. Don't let this distraction derail our investigation.

And if anyone has any "condolences" for my family, you can keep them to yourself.

Very Much Alive,

Sir,

You're not going to believe this, but Ellingson has reached out to the young hackers for help. They're claiming these kids might be the key to stopping Belford.

I think this is a mistake. These are criminals, not consultants.

Request permission to intervene and bring these hackers into custody.

Team,

Against my better judgment, we've been ordered to work with Ellingson and these young hackers to catch Belford.

I want round-the-clock surveillance on these kids. If they so much as jaywalk, I want to know about it.

Remember, they're not our friends. They're assets at best, suspects at worst.

Stay sharp.

Sir,

I've given this a lot of thought, and I believe it's time for me to move on from the Cybercrime Division.

This Ellingson case has shown me that I'm out of my depth with these tech-savvy criminals. Getting declared dead by a bunch of teenagers was the last straw.

I'd like to request a transfer back to Baltimore PD. I've spoken with some old colleagues, and they have an opening in their Homicide unit.

It's time I got back to some real police work, none of this cyber bunk.

Thank you for your understanding.

Team,

I wanted to let you all know that I've decided to leave the Cybercrime Division. I'll be returning to Baltimore to join their Homicide unit.

You're a talented group, and I know you'll crack this Ellingson case. As for me, I'm done with all this hacker bunk. Give me a good old-fashioned murder any day.

It's been an honor serving with you all. If you're ever in Baltimore, look me up. First round's on me.

P.S. Whoever declared me dead in the system - well played. But remember, what goes around, comes around.

Team,

Just a reminder to complete this month's security updates by EOD Friday. Pay special attention to the Gibson's firewall configurations.

Also, I'll be out of office next week for a conference. Direct any urgent matters to Margo.

Margo,

The package is ready. I'll deliver it at our usual spot tomorrow. Remember, this is just a test run. The real fun begins next week.

Make sure you've secured your exit strategy. Things are about to get interesting.

Mr. Benson,

I'm writing to request an increase in our cybersecurity budget. Given the rising threats in the digital landscape, I believe we need to invest in more advanced intrusion detection systems and employee training.

I've prepared a detailed proposal for your review. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.

M,

I've submitted my resignation. Two weeks from now, we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach while Ellingson burns. Make sure everything is in place on your end.

Remember, if anyone gets suspicious, you know nothing. As far as you're concerned, I'm leaving for a better opportunity elsewhere.

As you know, this is my final week at Ellingson. I'll be conducting knowledge transfer sessions each day. Please make sure you attend the relevant sessions for your role.

All outstanding projects should be documented and transitioned by EOD Friday.

Everything is in place. The Da Vinci virus will activate at midnight tomorrow. Make sure you're ready to play your part.

Remember, when things start going haywire, act surprised like everyone else. Your position in the company is our ace in the hole.

This time tomorrow, we'll be $25 million richer.

M,

We've got a problem. Those young hackers are interfering more than anticipated. I need you to do some damage control.

Delete any incriminating emails. Use the secure phone I gave you for any further communications.

If things get too hot, use the escape plan we discussed. The money's been transferred to the offshore account.

Stay calm. We're too close to let this fall apart now.
